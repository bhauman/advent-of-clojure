# Advent of Clojure

My [Advent of Code](http://adventofcode.com/) Solutions in Clojure.

## Code layout

**The solutions** are in the `src` directory.

**The problem statements** are in the `doc` directory.

**The problem inputs** are in the `resources` directory.

## How to use

If the problems are no longer available at the [Advent of
Code](http://adventofcode.com/) site, you can pick a challenge from
the `doc` directory.

When you are finished working on the problem, there are solutions
available for you to get another point of view on the problem.

See the [`src/advent`](https://github.com/bhauman/advent-of-clojure/tree/master/src/advent) directory for the solutions.

See the [`doc`](https://github.com/bhauman/advent-of-clojure/tree/master/doc)
directory for the problem statements.
