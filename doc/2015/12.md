# Day 12: JSAbacusFramework.io

Santa's Accounting-Elves need help balancing the books after a recent
order. Unfortunately, their accounting software uses a peculiar
storage format. That's where you come in.

They have a JSON document which contains a variety of things: arrays
(`[1,2,3]`), objects (`{"a":1, "b":2}`), numbers, and strings. Your first
job is to simply find all of the numbers throughout the document and
add them together.

For example:

`[1,2,3]` and `{"a":2,"b":4}` both have a sum of 6.

`[[[3]]]` and `{"a":{"b":4},"c":-1}` both have a sum of 3.

`{"a":[-1,1]}` and `[-1,{"a":1}]` both have a sum of 0.

`[]` and `{}` both have a sum of 0.

You will not encounter any strings containing numbers.

What is the sum of all numbers in the document?

Your puzzle answer was **`156366`**.

## Part Two

Uh oh - the Accounting-Elves have realized that they double-counted
everything red.

Ignore any object (and all of its children) which has any property
with the value `"red"`. Do this only for objects (`{...}`), not arrays
(`[...]`).

`[1,2,3]` still has a sum of 6.

`[1,{"c":"red","b":2},3]` now has a sum of 4, because the middle object is ignored.

`{"d":"red","e":[1,2,3,4],"f":5}` now has a sum of 0, because the entire structure is ignored.

`[1,"red",5]` has a sum of 6, because "red" in an array has no effect.

Your puzzle answer was **`96852`**.
