# Day 15: Science for Hungry People

Today, you set out on the task of perfecting your milk-dunking cookie
recipe. All you have to do is find the right balance of ingredients.

Your recipe leaves room for exactly 100 teaspoons of ingredients. You
make a list of the **remaining ingredients you could use to finish the
recipe** (your puzzle input) and their **properties per teaspoon**:

`capacity` (how well it helps the cookie absorb milk)

`durability` (how well it keeps the cookie intact when full of milk)

`flavor` (how tasty it makes the cookie)

`texture` (how it improves the feel of the cookie)

`calories` (how many calories it adds to the cookie)

You can only measure ingredients in whole-teaspoon amounts accurately,
and you have to be accurate so you can reproduce your results in the
future. The **total score** of a cookie can be found by adding up each of
the properties (negative totals become `0`) and then multiplying
together everything except calories.

For instance, suppose you have these two ingredients:

```
Butterscotch: capacity -1, durability -2, flavor 6, texture 3, calories 8
Cinnamon: capacity 2, durability 3, flavor -2, texture -1, calories 3
```

Then, choosing to use `44` teaspoons of butterscotch and `56` teaspoons of
cinnamon (because the amounts of each ingredient must add up to `100`)
would result in a cookie with the following properties:

```
A capacity of 44*-1 + 56*2 = 68
A durability of 44*-2 + 56*3 = 80
A flavor of 44*6 + 56*-2 = 152
A texture of 44*3 + 56*-1 = 76
```

Multiplying these together (`68 * 80 * 152 * 76`, ignoring `calories` for
now) results in a total score of `62842880`, which happens to be the
best score possible given these ingredients. If any properties had
produced a negative total, it would have instead become zero, causing
the whole score to multiply to zero.

Given the ingredients in your kitchen and their properties, what is
the total score of the highest-scoring cookie you can make?

Your puzzle answer was **`21367368`**.

## Part Two

Your cookie recipe becomes wildly popular! Someone asks if you can
make another recipe that has exactly 500 calories per cookie (so they
can use it as a meal replacement). Keep the rest of your award-winning
process the same (100 teaspoons, same ingredients, same scoring
system).

For example, given the ingredients above, if you had instead selected
40 teaspoons of butterscotch and 60 teaspoons of cinnamon (which still
adds to 100), the total calorie count would be `40*8 + 60*3 = 500`. The
total score would go down, though: only `57600000`, the best you can do
in such trying circumstances.

Given the ingredients in your kitchen and their properties, what is
the total score of the highest-scoring cookie you can make with a
calorie total of `500`?

Your puzzle answer was **`1766400`**.
