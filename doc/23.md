# Day 23: Opening the Turing Lock

Little Jane Marie just got her very first computer for Christmas from
some unknown benefactor. It comes with instructions and an example
program, but the computer itself seems to be malfunctioning. She's
curious what the program does, and would like you to help her run it.

The manual explains that the computer supports two registers and six
instructions (truly, it goes on to remind the reader, a
state-of-the-art technology). The registers are named a and b, can
hold any non-negative integer, and begin with a value of 0. The
instructions are as follows:

```
hlf r sets register r to half its current value, then continues with the next instruction.
tpl r sets register r to triple its current value, then continues with the next instruction.
inc r increments register r, adding 1 to it, then continues with the next instruction.
jmp offset is a jump; it continues with the instruction offset away relative to itself.
jie r, offset is like jmp, but only jumps if register r is even ("jump if even").
jio r, offset is like jmp, but only jumps if register r is 1 ("jump if one", not odd).
```

All three jump instructions work with an **offset** relative to that
instruction. The offset is always written with a prefix `+` or `-` to
indicate the direction of the jump (forward or backward,
respectively). For example, jmp `+1` would simply continue with the next
instruction, while jmp `+0` would continuously jump back to itself
forever.

The program exits when it tries to run an instruction beyond the ones
defined.

For example, this program sets a to `2`, because the `jio` instruction
causes it to skip the `tpl` instruction:

```
inc a
jio a, +2
tpl a
inc a
```

What is **the value in register `b`** when the program in your puzzle input
is finished executing?

Your puzzle answer was **`255`**.

## Part Two

The unknown benefactor is **very** thankful for releasi-- er, helping
little Jane Marie with her computer. Definitely not to distract you,
what is the value in register b after the program is finished
executing if register a starts as `1` instead?

Your puzzle answer was **`334`**.
